        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Senior Junior is a website that has been created to help express the following idea:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="post-quote">
                <p><i>So much focus is placed on speed and money these days.
                Instead of going that route, the focus here will be on learning and understanding.
                While my age matches that of other senior developers, my experience matches that of junior developers.
                To grow from junior to senior it will take time, but I plan to enjoy learning and gaining new understanding during that time.
                It would be easy to move fast with the help of AI, and churn out project after project to help land a job, 
                but slow and steady is fine by me.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>If you stick around and read the blog, I'll share what I do to learn, and highlight what I find fun and fascinating as a developer. 
            As I progress, I will collect all my work and projects below. Feel free to have a look around.</p>
